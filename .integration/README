Continuous integration
======================

Continuous integration (CI) tools, in the case of SimTaDyn project, is a pratice for building code source on different architectures (Linux, OS X, Window) and run unit tests for each git commit or github pull requests. This allows:
* to detect code regressions (running unit tests or static code analysis).
* to detect compilation regressions.
* to compile the project on several different architectures with different kind and version of compilators.

SimTaDyn uses three CI tools:
* [Travis CI](See https://travis-ci.org/) for Linux and OS X.
* [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for Windows.
* [Coverity Scan](https://scan.coverity.com/) for static code analysis.

Travis and Appveyor are triggered on each git commit and gith pull request while Coverity Scan is called manually.

Note: SimTaDyn needs Ubuntu 17.04 for GTK+ buts Ubuntu 16.04 is ok just for launching unit tests. Travis CI only uses Ubuntu 12.04 (and soon 14.04) which is too old for GTK+, but let use a docker. The last option is used for SimTaDyn continuous integration.
