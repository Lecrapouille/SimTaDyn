# SimTaDyn Installation Guide

This page explains how to compile the code source of the master branch. See other install files given on other git branches (specially the Original-Version-EPITA-2004 branch).

SimTaDyn is based on C++11, Modern OpenGL (>= 3.0), The C++ version of GTK+, the C++ version of GtkSourceView. In addition it needs the gtkmm >= 3.22 to work correctly. This choice was due to thee fact that on 2004 I enjoyed programming GTK+ and OpenGL was well integrated (with GtkGLExt) but in 2016, I get bored of C and decide to pass to C++ and after 12 years of absence, I did not realized soon that GTK+ stopped not maintaining correctly OpenGL.

## Ubuntu

Install dependencies for the master branch:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libgtksourceviewmm-3.0-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libdw-dev
```

Note: if you prefer compiling the legacy version of SimTaDyn, install the gtkmm-2.4 instead of gtkmm-3.0 (both versions can co-exist on your system):
```sh
sudo libgtkglextmm-x11-1.2-dev libgtkmm-2.4-dev
```

Optionally, for launching unit test, install the following packages:
```sh
libcppunit-dev gcovr libglm-dev
```

And even more optionally for generating some expected unit test results, install the Scilab fork: [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/)
```sh
sudo apt-get install scicoslab-gtk
```

Concerning libgtkmm-3.0-dev: t's mandatory to install the gtkmm version 3.22 due to a major bug with the OpenGL widget breaking the OpenGL context when using inheritance. See this [bug](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn/blob/master/doc/Bugs.md). for more informations. This version is not present on Ubuntu older than 17.04. That's mean on Ubuntu version (16.04, 16.11) youâ€™ll have to install it by compiling sources by yourself (need long time to compile but the process compiles well).

If needed, for fixing some Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "overlay-scrollbar":
```sh
sudo apt-get install overlay-scrollbar*
```

## Mac OS X

SimTaDyn compiles on a MacBook Air and Mac OS X 10.9.5. To install gtkmm and other dependencies use the tool [homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_fr.html). The current gtkmm version is 3.22 and no problem occurred during the compilation of these libs. however the Gtk::GlArea is not implemented on this architecture and by consequence the OpenGL context is not created.

## Other architecture

Not yet tested/done. No development scheduled yet.

Because Cygwin stopped being ported on Windows XP, you need higher Window version (which it's not my case currently).

## Compilation

Get the SimTaDyn source, compile them and install resources:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn.git
cd SimTaDyn/src
make
make install-data
```

Explanations:
* the make command will create the SimTaDyn/build directory and compile the executable on here.
* the make install is not yet implemented (because this project is still in developement). So, for the moment call SimTaDyn from the sources.
* thee make install-data will create a hidden directory at $HOME/.SimTaDyn and copy some needed files.

## Run

To launch SimTaDyn once compiled:
```sh
cd SimTaDyn/build
./SimTaDyn
```

Note:
* Be sure you typed ``make install-data`` before launching the executable. SimTaDyn needs these files installed.
