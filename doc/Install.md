# SimTaDyn Installation Guide

This page explains how to compile the code source for the **master branch**. For other SimTaDyn branches (specially for the [Original-Version-EPITA-2004 branch](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn/tree/Original-Version-EPITA-2004)), read the install file associated to the branch.

SimTaDyn is based on C++11, modern OpenGL (>= 3.0), gtkmm >= 3.22 and gtksourceviewmm (C++ interfaces for GTK+ and GtkSourceView) and other small libraries like libSOIL (for loading image files),  

Important note: gtkmm >= 3.22 is mandatory to get SimTaDyn worked correctly with OpenGL.

## Ubuntu

Concerning libgtkmm-3.0-dev: t's mandatory to install the gtkmm version 3.22 due to a major bug with the OpenGL widget breaking the OpenGL context when using inheritance. See this [bug](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn/blob/master/doc/Bugs.md) for more informations. This version is not present on Ubuntu older than 17.04. That's mean on Ubuntu version 16.04, 16.11, youâ€™ll have to install it by compiling sources by yourself (need long time to compile but the process compiles well) or use Docker with an Ubuntu 17.04 image.

### Ubuntu 17.04

For Ubuntu >= 17.04, install the following dependencies:
```sh
sudo apt-get install libgtksourceviewmm-3.0-dev freeglut3 freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libdw-dev libsoil-dev binutils-dev
```

Optionally, for launching unit tests, install the following packages:
```sh
libcppunit-dev gcovr libglm-dev
```

And even more optionally, for generating some expected unit test results, install the Scilab fork: [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/)
```sh
sudo apt-get install scicoslab-gtk
```

If needed, for fixing some Gtk-Message: Failed to load module "overlay-scrollbar":
```sh
sudo apt-get install overlay-scrollbar*
```

### Other Ubuntu versions

For Ubuntu versions < 17.04, if you have a 64-bits machine you could install [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), pull an image of Ubuntu 17.04 and inside the docker, follow instructions [described here](#docker). If you have a 32-bits, unfortuatly Docker does not support 32-bits architecture, so you will have to install by yourself a gtkmm version >= 3.22.

## Docker

- Install docker. For example, if you have an Ubuntu 16.04, [follow these steps](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04).
- Clone the project and go inside, this will the entry point for your docker:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn.git
cd SimTaDyn
```
- Download the image of Ubuntu and launch the docker in an interactive bash where the root of the docker is the root of the SimTaDyn project:
```sh
docker pull ubuntu:17.04
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/SimTaDyn" -td ubuntu:17.04 /bin/bash
```
- Now you are inside the docker, follow:
- [these steps](#ubuntu-17.04) for installing libraries for SimTaDyn.
- [these steps](#Compilation) for compiling SimTaDyn.

## Mac OS X

SimTaDyn compiles on a MacBook Air and Mac OS X 10.9.5. To install gtkmm and other dependencies use the tool [homebrew](https://brew.sh/index_fr.html). The current gtkmm version is 3.22 and no problem occurred during the compilation of these libs. However the Gtk::GlArea is not implemented on this architecture and by consequence the OpenGL context is not created !

## Other architecture

Not yet tested/done. No development scheduled yet.

Because Cygwin stopped being ported on Windows XP, you need higher Window version (which it's not my case currently).

## Compilation

Get the SimTaDyn source, compile them and install resources:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lecrapouille/SimTaDyn.git
cd SimTaDyn/src
make
make install-data
```

Explanations:
* the make command will create the SimTaDyn/build directory and compile the executable on here.
* the make install is not yet implemented (because this project is still in developement). So, for the moment call SimTaDyn from the sources.
* thee make install-data will create a hidden directory at $HOME/.SimTaDyn and copy some needed files.

## Run

To launch SimTaDyn once compiled:
```sh
cd SimTaDyn/build
./SimTaDyn
```

Note:
* Be sure you typed ``make install-data`` before launching the executable. SimTaDyn needs these files installed.
