* Graph.[ch]pp: Class for defining a graph and its
  nodes/arcs. Minimalist classes to be used as class ancestor in
  inheritance.

* GraphContainer.tpp: Special container for nodes and arcs and huge
  graph. Minimise the number of new operations. Abstract some boring
  operations for user like pending data (changed data), visited nodes.

* GraphAlgorithm.[ch]pp: more used for testing some basic graph theory
  algorithms than useful class for SimTaDyn.
